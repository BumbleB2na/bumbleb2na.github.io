## Stories Gone Mad!

[![Google Play](https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.BumbleB2na.StoriesGoneMad) [![App Store](http://mobilewebsmart.com/StoriesGoneMad/images/Download_on_the_App_Store_Badge_US-UK_135x40.svg)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stories-gone-mad/id724532866?ls=1)

Read familiar classics, like The Three Little Pigs, then play a game to mix up the words. Each story was adapted to work as a template.

This mobile app is built using Front-End code and a .Net/SQL backend. The code is not on github. I built a .Net backend that is like a custom CMS used for creating story templates. I finished development on it in 2013, back when a paid version of an app was a more common business model. Without ads I make just enough sales each year to offset the cost of renewing an iOS Developer Certificate. If you want to try out the free version, then leave a nice review on the app store, I would be grateful.
