## Stories Gone Mad!

Read familiar classics, like The Three Little Pigs, then play a game to mix up the words. Each story was adapted to work as a template.

This mobile app is built using Front-End code and a .Net/SQL backend. The code is not on github. I built a .Net backend that is like a custom CMS used for creating story templates. I finished development on it in 2013, back when a paid version of an app was a more common business model. Without ads I make just enough sales each year to offset the cost of renewing an iOS Developer Certificate. If you want to try out the free version, then leave a nice review on the app store, I would be grateful.

# Code samples
See my latest [github repositories](https://github.com/BumbleB2na?tab=repositories) for a sample of what sort of things I am in to.

Or, my [JSFiddle.net profile](https://jsfiddle.net/user/BumbleB2na/fiddles/) has a few older code examples.

I have done some Q&A [Stackoverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/285714/bumbleb2na) on Stackoverflow.

You might be here to review my code to better understand how I work. As I get more in to open-source I'll expand here with a better walkthrough of my repositories. If you need me to write a coding test, please understand that I do not want to commit any more than 2 hours of my time. I would want to work in a public github repository, committing code as I go so that you can see how I would manage in an Agile environment. Thank you.
