I am a Fullstack Developer. I have a love for front-end technologies and always considered it a major asset while still making leaps with server-side development. This has made me more suitable for working on web and mobile application projects. I started with Web and Flash, moved in to .Net and Javascript, and lately have been working with MEAN stack a lot more. Throughout this experience I have consistently kept my skills up to date with frontend.  
  
### Repositories
I am using Github for public projects only or to watch libraries that I am interested in at the time. I currently use Bitbucket for a lot of project work because it has free private respositories. That's why you won't see much activity from me on my [Github profile](https://github.com/BumbleB2na).
  
### Projects
I have shared a couple of projects on Github that I wanted to make public. I am selective with what I share because when I share something I want it to be useful for others.  
  
I learn by doing. I enjoy to focus on a single project in my spare time. An example of this is my [Stories Gone Mad app](https://mobilewebsmart.com/StoriesGoneMad).
ore organized.  
  
### Blogging
I tried blogging for awhile but do not do that much any more. Currently, I contribute pages and documentation with the team I work with. All of that is private.  
  
### Code samples
The way that we work has changed a lot over the last several years. Some developers like to post code snippets on Github or templates for projects. Currently, I do more of that offline or on my [JSFiddle.net profile](https://jsfiddle.net/user/BumbleB2na/fiddles/).  
  
### Forums
I use my [Stackoverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/285714/bumbleb2na) for Q&A. I have been less active on there in recent years probably because I have been working in a more collaborative environment.
