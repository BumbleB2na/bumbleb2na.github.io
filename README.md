Hi, ðŸ‘‹ I develop mobile-friendly web applications, apps and intranets. I am a Full Stack developer with my top skills on the Microsoft stack. I have recent experience with Angular. Currently using React and SharePoint Online. I have additional experience with Node.js, Serverless and AWS Cloud. My added strength is a strong understanding of Front End development that began with building websites and apps as a hobby. I now develop enterprise-level web applications from end-to-end.
  
### Projects
I've developed a mobile app, [Stories Gone Mad](https://mobilewebsmart.com/StoriesGoneMad) using front-end code and a .Net/SQL backend.

### Code samples
See my latest [github repositories](https://github.com/BumbleB2na?tab=repositories).

Or, my [JSFiddle.net profile](https://jsfiddle.net/user/BumbleB2na/fiddles/) has a few older code examples.
