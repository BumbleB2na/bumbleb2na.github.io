## Online Activity

### Projects
I am using Github for public projects only or to watch libraries that I am interested in at the time. I currently use Bitbucket for a lot of project work because it has free private respositories. That's why you won't see much activity from me on my [Github profile](https://github.com/BumbleB2na).
  
I learn by doing. I enjoy to focus on a single project in my spare time. An example of this is my [Stories Gone Mad app](https://mobilewebsmart.com/StoriesGoneMad).

The way that we work has changed a lot over the last several years. Some developers like to post code snippets on Github or templates for projects. Currently, I do more of that offline. I want my Github profile to look more organized.

I use:
* Stackoverflow for Q&A: http://stackoverflow.com/users/285714/bumbleb2na  
* Github for projects I want to make public: https://github.com/BumbleB2na  
* Bitbucket for private projects. 
* JSFiddle.net to play with front-end code: https://jsfiddle.net/user/BumbleB2na/fiddles/
